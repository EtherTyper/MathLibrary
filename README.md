# MathLibrary

This is my (Eli Bradley's) computer science project, a Kotlin DSL focusing on various topics I've learned about
through school and just on my own. This includes:

## Introduction
MathLibrary is a comprehensive Kotlin Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to facilitate a wide range of mathematical operations, including vector algebra, multivariable calculus, and quantum computing simulations. Developed out of a passion for applying computer science concepts to real-world mathematical problems, this library serves as a toolkit for developers seeking to simplify complex calculations and simulations.

## Features
MathLibrary offers a robust set of features across various domains:
- **Vector Algebra**: Perform operations on vectors with ease.
- **Multivariable Calculus**: Simplify multivariable functions and gradient descent calculations.
  - Gradient Descent
- **Linear Algebra**: Manipulate matrices and solve linear equations.
- **Electrostatic Simulations**: Simulate electrostatic forces and fields.
- **Analytic Transformations**: Explore Taylor series and dive into Fourier series and transformations.
- **Complex Algebra**: Work with complex numbers, vectors, and matrices effortlessly.
- **Quantum Computing**: Design and test quantum circuits with support for entangled states and quantum gates, including parallel and sequential gates, and measuring techniques.

## Installation
To integrate MathLibrary into your Kotlin project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Kotlin set up in your IDE .
2. Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:
    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.yourusername:MathLibrary:latest-version'
    }
    ```
3. Sync your project to download the library.
